Looking into faster node graph lookups. The design document calls for "sets"
of nodes so we aren't checking each one. Ideally, "sets" would be context-aware
and be able to provide the searcher with a few "hints" as to what nodes should
be checked (building, etc.)

Moved all work done in tests/mapgen_tests to base game directory.

Entities can now make noises. Currently NPCs use them to send a callback to
the hearer that causes them to update the potential location of a lost target.
In the future this functionality might change to allow an NPC to mistake a sound
as being made by the wrong target.

Cleaned up a few draw calls to only include entities visible to the player.
Observer Mode can be enabled by hitting `o` - this will draw all NPCs
and items regardless of whether the player can see them.
